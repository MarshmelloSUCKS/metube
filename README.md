# MeTube. Broadcast myself.
MeTube is a little project I decided to make after having the idea, "what about YouTube, but for me? And straight from 2006?" This repository is meant for NeoCities users, although anyone can clone as they please. MeTube is intended to be placed in a "videos" folder within the root directory of a site. All you need to do to set up MeTube is download the repository, change the files as you please (but please leave "template by MarshmelloSUCKS"), upload, and share! MeTube is intended to be used for HTML5 video, so any videos encoded in H.264 (MP4) or VP8/VP9 (WebM) should be playable on most modern browsers. Alternate download links are also provided for those with less up-to-date browsers.
